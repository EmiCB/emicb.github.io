A puzzle platformer I made with [my brother](https://rboyce.com/) for the Ludum Dare Discord Jam (#5) with the theme: "mutation".

<!--more-->

- Designed gameplay and level
- Made all art assets
- Using Unity & C#, and Aseprite

## Features
- Single puzzle level with time limit
- Power-ups attach to different parts of the body and grant specific abilities
	- **Speed up** - makes the player run much faster
	- **Double jump** - allows the play to jump one more time
	- **Wall hang** - allows the player to grab onto walls
	- **Fast drop** - allows player to break through destructible platforms
- Simple animations (display what the power-ups do)
