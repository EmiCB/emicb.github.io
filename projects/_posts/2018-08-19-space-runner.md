- Designed entire game (took inspiration from the Dinosaur Game)
- Using Unity & C#, and Aseprite

## Features

- Object pooling for ground tiles and obstacles (alien ships the the air, jagged rocks on the ground)
- Player speeds up as time goes on
- Screen closes in around player, limiting visibility in later stages
