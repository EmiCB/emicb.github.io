This game was my submission for the Ludum Dare 42 game jam (theme: running out of space). 

<!--more-->

I took the theme quite literally in multiple senses. The player is running through a strange planet in an attempt to escape while the screen closes in around them. As time goes on, the player speeds up and visibility is decreased, making survival much more difficult. It is not perfect, but I would like to keep it as it is so I can continue to document my progress as I participate in more game jams in the future.
