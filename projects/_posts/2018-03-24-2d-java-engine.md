This is a game engine that I programmed using Java and the Eclipse IDE. I used MajoolWIP's tutorial series to help guide me through its creation. The goal of this project was for me to see how game engines were made and learn how computers processed graphics. This section actually contains two projects. The engine is paired with a simple platformer game (also created in Java) that was made to test out the engine's capabilities.
