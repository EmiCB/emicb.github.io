A virtual reality phone app that uses Google Cardboard to help students visualize and interract with molecular structures.

<!--more-->

This is a project that I worked on at the University of Illinois through the NCSA SPIN program. It is a virtual reality app developed for iOS and Android to be used with Google Cardboard, allowing it to be cheaper and more accessible to students. Molecular structures can be selected, rotated, and moved around the scene. I have also implemented gaze input, which allows the user to stare at a button for two seconds in place of physically pressing the Cardboard's button. The molecules are imported into the app through a webserver using assetbundling and the list is auto-generated so that the contents of the app can be easily updated without the users having to update the app themselves.
