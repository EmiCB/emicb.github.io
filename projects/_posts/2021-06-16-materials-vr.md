- Project with Professor Schleife for the NCSA SPIN program at UIUC (2017)
- Developed both iOS and Android apps
- Made for Google Cardboard (cheaper and more accessible)
- Using Unity & C#, Xcode, VSCode, and Cardboard XR plugin
	- Utilizes Unity Asset Bundles to pull molecules from a webserver (easier to update app content, smaller app download)

## Features
- Auto-generating molecule list
- Gaze input - stare at a button or object for 2 seconds to select it (hands-free)
- Rotate molecules
- Drag and drop molecules to any position
