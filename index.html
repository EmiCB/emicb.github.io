                <h4>Space Runner</h4>
                <p>This game way my submission for the Ludum Dare 42 jam (theme: running out of space). It is not perfect, but I would like to keep it as is so I can continue to document my progress as I do more game jams in the future.</p>

                <h4>RoomVR</h4>
                <p>This is a virtual reality representation of Emma Donoghue's Room made for my Hero's Journey class' creative project. It uses Unity 2018.3.14f1 and GVR 1.2. Currently, it is an iOS app that runs on Google Cardboard. The user can change between the heights of Jack and Ma by pressing the button on the Cardboard (the equivalent of tapping the screen or clicking on a PC). Lighting can be changed by gazing at Skylight or Lampâ€™s shade for about 2 seconds. I chose to represent the objects in Room with simple shapes in order to more clearly show the amount of space that was available. Some smaller objects such as the foldable chairs, Plant, and Bunny are not in this scene, but may be added in the future.</p>
